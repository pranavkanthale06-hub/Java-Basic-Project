# Java-Basic-Project
The "Transaction system in java" is a desktop-based financial management application designed to facilitate secure and efficient banking operations. In an era where digital financial literacy is paramount, this system provides a simulation of core banking features including user authentication, real-time balance updates, and transaction history tracking.
Key features of the Transaction System include:
•	Role-Based Access Control: Distinct functionalities for Administrators (creating accounts) and Users (performing transactions).
•	Transaction Management: Users can perform Deposits, Withdrawals, and Fund Transfers to other users.
•	Data Persistence: The system utilizes Java Serialization to store user profiles and transaction records in local files (users.dat and transactions.dat), ensuring data remains intact even after the application is closed.
•	Interactive GUI: Built using Java Swing, the application offers a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation.
The technical infrastructure is built entirely on Core Java. The backend logic is handled by a DataService class that manages object storage and retrieval. The frontend utilizes JFrame and JPanel components to create a responsive dashboard. This project demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, File I/O, and Event-Driven Programming in Java.
